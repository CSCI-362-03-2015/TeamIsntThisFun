###How-To Documentation

Prerequisites: Python 2.7+

The first step is to clone the TeamIsntThisFun repository. Afterwards, clone the repository located at Beets Github into the /project/src folder in the cloned TeamIsntThisFun repository.

To run the automated testing framework navigate to the folder IsntThisFun/scripts.

With these commands, “chmod +x runAllTests.sh” and “./runAllTests.sh”, the testing framework should execute automatically and output a test report in a web browser.
